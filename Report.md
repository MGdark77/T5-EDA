Mohammed Almalki
# Abstract
Renewable energy contributes to preserving the environment from pollution, and in the future the world will dispense with traditional energy, We will apply data analytics on the Hourly historical weather data for all Saudi Arabia to identify the best regions for the establishment of renewable energy projects (solar energy and wind energy).
# Design
The data used in this project fromhttps://www.kaggle.com/esraamadi/saudi-arabia-weather-history.  in this project we'll be answering the following questions along the way: what is the best regions for the establishment of solar energy and wind energy stations and What are the climatic factors that influence the choice of region?
# Data
Number of rows= 249023, Number of columns= 15.
# Algorithms
