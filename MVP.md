### Objective:
The objective of this data analysis is to identify the best regions for the establishment of renewable energy projects (solar energy and wind energy).

**This data visualization was a 28-month study of the weather in Saudi Arabia**

We conclude from this data visualization the highest regions in the rate of sunny weather and the highest regions in the average wind:

- The **x-axis** shows the regions as the **y-axis** shows the average of sunny weather in each region and average of wind speed.
- The Top 5 regions of highest average of sunny is:
1. NB (Northern borders)
2. Madina
3. Aljawf
4. ER (Eastern Region)
5. Tabuk
We will chose three regions of top 5 After looking at Temperature and Humidity rate.

- The Top 5 regions of highest average of wind speed is:
1. ER (Eastern Region)
2. Baha
3. Mecca
4. Aljawf
5. NB (Northern borders)

After looking at this data visualization, we choose the appropriate regions for solar energy based on the balance between the rate of sun appearance, temperature and humidity:
- The **x-axis** shows the regions as the **y-axis** shows the average of temperature in each region and average of humidity.
- We We chose three regions from the previous candidate:
1. NB (Northern borders)
2. Aljawf
3. Tabuk

After looking at this data visualization, we notice that the frequency of average speed doesn't even reach out to 30 km/h and there is some hours doesn't record:

- The x-axis shows the months as the y-axis shows the average of wind speed  of all regions.
- The minimum wind speed in order to move the turbine is approximately 13km/h But the generation efficiency starts from 28 and takes into account the size of the turbine and the height of its tower.
- We need to verify the validity of the data and we need to study the level of the hihg of the turbine tower and what it adds as a auxiliary factor.

### **Conclusion:**
We will try to find out is there a possibility to connect the stations in the regions close to each other by knowing the synchronization of the weather change from one region to another.
